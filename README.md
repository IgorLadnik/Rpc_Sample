# Rpc_Sample
Remote Procedure Call on .NET5

<p>
Presented solution is based on **SignalR** library for inter-process communication. It uses WebSocket as its main transport type 
with long polling as a fallback.
</p>
<p>
Solution provides the following features for inter-process communication in .NET 5.
</p>
<p>

## 1. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Using Interface.
</p>
<p>
An interface is registered in client and server. 
The server provides class implementing the interface. 
Client calls method *RpcAsync()* taking interface and method names as arguments, 
Client along with arguments of the method itself.
Then the method is executed on server side and client gets its result.
Broadcasting result to other clients may be implemented, if requireed.
Server supports Singleton, PerCall and PerSession instance models, similar to WCF.
One way call ("fire-and-forget") is also implemented with method *RpcOneWay()*.
</p>
<p>

## 2. RPC with Asynchronous Response
</p>
<p>
Implementation of this feature requires class derived from *RpcAndStreamingHub&lt;Message&gt;* on 
the server side with method to be called. Client method InvokeAsync() provides the feature.
</p>
<p>

## 3. Streaming
</p>
<p>
Client may subscibe to a stream generated by server with method *Subscribe&lt;Message&gt;*
</p>
